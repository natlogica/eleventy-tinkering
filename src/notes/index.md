Welcome to my digital garden!

This will be an entry point to the pool of notes. I would like to put a word cloud in here somewhere.

The index should allow for easy navigation. In Obsidian preferences, I have Wikilinks turned off so that links will default to markdown format. This should hopefully play nice with eleventy when the notes are compiled.

It should link to the main paths, like this one [Yak Shaving](202112111131.md). The links are very important to form the network of ideas. Using the markdown format for links might get a bit tiresome, especially if I have to maintain them manually. I like having the filename stay consistent, though, even if the title evolves. I want to only have to change the title in the metadata, though, so I need the page title to be automated from that information.

I'm [curious about many things](202112111306.md) right now. I have done a little bit of work writing stories in Twine, and it turns out that I can do the same thing here. I'm feeling excited about hypertext again!
