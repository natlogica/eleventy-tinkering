In this space, I want to make a quick note of what I'm curious about.

Today, I want to learn more about JavaScript and get some practice. I think I will check out [Wes Bos's course](https://beginnerjavascript.com/) I want to eventually be able to develop my own Obsidian plugins.

I also want to learn to make SVG images in code and find out about how to animate them, too.

Check out my [Readings](202203041232) note to see what I am reading lately.
