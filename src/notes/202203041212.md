In Obsidian, I don't have to put an H1 tag here because it will eventually be generated by eleventy from the yaml metadata. Tags are also kept in the metadata.

Next I will be using [binyamin's](https://github.com/binyamin/eleventy-garden) javascript for notes pages.

The links are done using Markdown syntax, with a square bracket enclosing the anchor and parenthesis containing the url. This keeps things consistent in appearance whether using internal or external links. This also keeps my internal links robust if I later choose to retitle a note as it evolves over time.

Since every note name is simply its timestamp at inception, it is difficult to navigate when I am developing the notes. Once they are instantiated using 11ty, the html titles and tags are clickable.
